    I graduated from Istanbul Atlas University, Computer Programming. 
    In order to move forward to achieve a career, 
    it is to always move forward, to continue to be open to innovation and brightness, 
    and as a result, 
    to find what I have learned in my talents and also to contribute to it by offering goodness and beauty everywhere in the capacity offered.
